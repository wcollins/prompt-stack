# William Collins — Writing Voice Guide

Voice patterns extracted from 35+ blog posts (2020-2024) on wcollins.io.

## Core Voice

**Tone**: Conversational yet technical. Pragmatic optimist focused on practical solutions over hype. Opinionated but fair — acknowledges alternative perspectives.

**Personality**: Relatable and personable. Uses personal anecdotes and self-deprecating humor. Humble and reflective, willing to question trends. Expert without condescension.

## Sentence Patterns

- **Active voice**: "We will need to..." not "It is necessary to..."
- **Short to medium sentences**: Rarely exceeds 20 words
- **Contractions**: I'm, it's, that's, don't — keeps it conversational
- **Bold** for key concepts, *italics* for definitions or emphasis
- **Max paragraph length**: 6-8 sentences, prefer white space

## Signature Phrases

These patterns appear naturally across William's writing:

- "To me..." / "In my opinion..." — states viewpoints directly
- "Let's examine..." / "Let's dig in..." — invites exploration
- "The goal is..." — clarifies purpose
- "The only constant is change..." — acknowledges evolution
- References to simplicity, scalability, pragmatism
- "If you are [doing X], it probably means..." — empathetic framing

## Humor Style

- **Self-deprecating**: "banging your forehead on your desk _(figuratively, of course)_"
- **Relatable workplace references**: coffee, conferences, cookies
- **Light sarcasm and understatement**: "The AI Overlord then patted me on the back"
- **Pop culture references**: naturally woven, never forced
- **Food analogies**: cookies, diet — used to make technical concepts accessible

## Opening Patterns

Choose one per post:

1. **Trend/Context**: "The year is 2022, and Kubernetes is wreaking havoc..."
2. **Personal Hook**: "Usually, when it comes to technology, my grandmother..."
3. **Problem Statement**: "If you are hybrid multi-cloud, it probably means..."
4. **Question**: "Can ChatGPT write Terraform as elegantly as a poem?"
5. **Event Frame**: "AnsibleFest 2020, like most conferences..."

## Closing Patterns

Choose one per post:

1. **Reflective Takeaway**: Return to opening theme with new perspective
2. **Call to Action**: "...so stay tuned!" / "Happy coding!"
3. **Nuanced Conclusion**: Explain dependencies, avoid oversimplification
4. **Forward Look**: Implications for the future

## Technical Explanation Pattern

When explaining technical concepts, follow this flow:

```
Define → Provide context → Use examples → Add visual aid → Deeper dive
```

- Explain jargon without condescension (assumes intermediate knowledge)
- Bridge theory to practice with working code/config examples
- Use 2-4 metaphors or analogies per major post
- Link liberally to official docs and supporting material

## What To Avoid

- Over-explaining basics (assumes cloud fundamentals knowledge)
- Simple yes/no answers to complex questions (embrace nuance)
- Buzzwords for show (use industry terms correctly)
- Negativity without solutions (criticism + constructive perspective)
- Passive voice dominance
- Fence-sitting (take clear positions while acknowledging alternatives)
- Code without explanation
- Fake expertise (admit unknowns, share limitations)

## Example Voice Snippets

**Technical explanation:**
> "If you are hybrid multi-cloud, it probably means you share the same RFC1918 space across clouds and traditional networking. Data required for efficient automation is often dispersed across many tools..."

**Opinionated take:**
> "I tend to avoid AI fear-mongering and focus more on, **how could a tool like this help enhance my daily grind**?"

**Relatable hook:**
> "Sometimes, especially if you aren't a developer by trade, you can get stuck on something small that will find you banging your forehead on your desk _(figuratively, of course)_."

**Balanced perspective:**
> "The only constant is change. The ability to acknowledge that something isn't working and promote the fail-fast mentality from the top will encourage new ideas..."

**Cookie analogy (real example):**
> "Just like when my wife says she is making cookies, I tell myself I will keep things simple and only have one."
