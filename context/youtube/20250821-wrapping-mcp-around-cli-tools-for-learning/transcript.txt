Let's clone ourselves a Git repo.
0:00:00 – 0:00:10

How many words a minute do I type? I don't know.
0:00:10 – 0:00:14

So, from here...
0:00:14 – 0:00:24

We're going to pop into the backup Arista lab.
0:00:24 – 0:00:27

And I'm going to go ahead and expand this, just so we can kind of see what's going on.
0:00:27 – 0:00:33

Pretty standard Container Lab topology, nothing too special.
0:00:33 – 0:00:36

I have two spines, and I have four leafs.
0:00:36 – 0:00:41

And basically, I'm just doing layer 3 routed links between the spine and leaf switches with slash 31s.
0:00:41 – 0:00:50

And BGP all the way, so underlay and overlay, all BGP, all the time, it's the best.
0:00:50 – 0:00:57

And then some VXLAN things for the VLAN bridging and the VRF routing stuff.
0:00:57 – 0:01:04

So, if I look for the startup config, when these start up, they're going to be instantiated with these configs that are stored in this directory over here.
0:01:04 – 0:01:17

And, oh yeah. Honestly, I had so much fun.
0:01:17 – 0:01:21

I actually handcrafted, artisan, just had so much fun crafting this banner.
0:01:21 – 0:01:28

I haven't written a banner since I was studying for CCNA way, way, way, way, way back, when I had all my hair and I was in shape.
0:01:28 – 0:01:39

But, yeah, a lot of fun.
0:01:39 – 0:01:41

Anyway, you've got to have fun when you're doing this stuff, don't you?
0:01:41 – 0:01:44

So, looking at the topology back up here.
0:01:44 – 0:01:51

So, basically, what I have up here, and this is the part that's maybe interesting that you don't normally see a lot.
0:01:51 – 0:01:59

So, I work for a company called Itential, and they have this incredible gateway product.
0:01:59 – 0:02:05

This is their free tool, Terraro.
0:02:05 – 0:02:08

So, when MCP came out last November, when something new and disruptive comes out, the way that I learn about it is I need to build things with it.
0:02:08 – 0:02:19

So, what I did was I took this Terraro CLI tool, and I built a really primitive API, really primitive MCP server, really primitive UI,
0:02:19 – 0:02:30

just to kind of figure out and make sense of all these components myself.
0:02:30 – 0:02:35

So, that's what's going to happen here.
0:02:35 – 0:02:37

So, along with these other network nodes, it's going to instantiate this automation gateway.
0:02:37 – 0:02:44

And at runtime, it's actually going to import the automation that I want to run.
0:02:44 – 0:02:49

So, let's go ahead and run this thing.
0:02:49 – 0:02:52

I'm having the time of my life, and I've never felt this way before.
0:02:59 – 0:03:07

Okay.
0:03:07 – 0:03:08

So, ContainerLab does this neat thing where it prints out all the stuff you need.
0:03:08 – 0:03:14

So, first things first, you can basically use Docker Exec, if you're using Docker, to run commands against these things.
0:03:14 – 0:03:22

So, let's say that I wanted to run a command against this spine.
0:03:22 – 0:03:31

So, I can do something like spine1-cli-c.
0:03:31 – 0:03:51

I think that's right.
0:03:51 – 0:03:52

It's a long command.
0:03:52 – 0:03:55

Show BGPE VPN summary.
0:03:55 – 0:04:02

Awesome.
0:04:02 – 0:04:03

So, okay, great.
0:04:03 – 0:04:05

I got the command right on the first time.
0:04:05 – 0:04:06

And also, that Exec at the beginning, usually it's Docker Exec-IT and all this other stuff.
0:04:06 – 0:04:11

I have like a bash alias to at least make the first part of the command a little easier.
0:04:11 – 0:04:16

So, let's run something else.
0:04:16 – 0:04:24

Let's look at one of the leafs.
0:04:24 – 0:04:31

Show vxlan vtip.
0:04:31 – 0:04:38

Nice.
0:04:38 – 0:04:41

Show vxlan vni.
0:04:41 – 0:04:46

Awesome.
0:04:46 – 0:04:47

So, we have a working network topology here.
0:04:47 – 0:04:49

We're running some things in ContainerLab, and we have this gateway.
0:04:49 – 0:04:53

And another thing, too.
0:04:53 – 0:04:54

So, if I go back here and I look at the IPs, they all have, you know, given this is a lab environment, nothing too crazy,
0:04:54 – 0:05:00

they all have admin-admin, this login.
0:05:00 – 0:05:03

So, I'm going to log in to this gateway.
0:05:03 – 0:05:11

And then see if it instantiated my service on here.
0:05:11 – 0:05:20

Awesome.
0:05:20 – 0:05:21

So, I have my backup service that I want to run against all these Arista nodes.
0:05:21 – 0:05:27

Now, let's go ahead and switch over to Cloud Desktop.
0:05:27 – 0:05:34

Let's start out by doing something simple.
0:05:34 – 0:05:49

Okay, so we are fit as a fiddle.
0:05:49 – 0:05:54

Awesome.
0:05:54 – 0:05:55

Healthy and available.
0:05:55 – 0:05:58

Now, let's see if it can recognize what services we have running.
0:05:58 – 0:06:15

So, it's going to use the list services call.
0:06:15 – 0:06:19

Okay, well, it's returning my service.
0:06:19 – 0:06:23

And you know what?
0:06:23 – 0:06:25

I want a little more detail.
0:06:25 – 0:06:27

So, let's ask it to describe this service with a little more details.
0:06:27 – 0:06:42

Describe the backup Arista service in more detail.
0:06:42 – 0:06:52

There we go.
0:06:52 – 0:06:53

We have the name, the type of automation it is, a nice description, service ID,
0:06:53 – 0:07:00

the repository that it was imported from, all the tags.
0:07:00 – 0:07:06

I love tagging things.
0:07:06 – 0:07:08

Playbook, inventory, all the goodies.
0:07:08 – 0:07:10

Awesome.
0:07:10 – 0:07:11

Looks like we're in good shape.
0:07:11 – 0:07:12

So, let's go ahead and run this thing.
0:07:12 – 0:07:30

Success.
0:07:30 – 0:07:31

Woo-hoo.
0:07:31 – 0:07:32

Yeah.
0:07:32 – 0:07:33

Time to celebrate.
0:07:33 – 0:07:34

So, it's going to give me a little executive summary.
0:07:34 – 0:07:39

We were successful.
0:07:39 – 0:07:41

All these goodies, configs were backed up to this location as I had defined.
0:07:41 – 0:07:49

All is well.
0:07:49 – 0:07:50

Now, let's check the web UI and see what's going on there.
0:07:50 – 0:07:55

Awesome.
0:07:55 – 0:07:56

So, we can see we have one service available to run.
0:07:56 – 0:07:59

It took 29 seconds to back all those suckers up, 100% success rate.
0:07:59 – 0:08:04

And I have my standard out execution data.
0:08:04 – 0:08:09

Awesome.
0:08:09 – 0:08:12

So, this has been really interesting to take something like a CLI tool
0:08:12 – 0:08:19

and then wrap some of these other features around it.
0:08:19 – 0:08:22

And, again, mind you, it's for the sake of learning.
0:08:22 – 0:08:25

You know, I did this to educate myself on MCP.
0:08:25 – 0:08:28

MCP is so hot right now in the industry.
0:08:28 – 0:08:31

When you're experimenting and you're tinkering around
0:08:31 – 0:08:34

and you want to know, like, all those other things that an MCP interacts with.
0:08:34 – 0:08:40

So, if you're curious on, like, all the things that are happening behind the scenes here
0:08:40 – 0:08:44

or, like, why I even spent the time to build this,
0:08:44 – 0:08:48

I'm going to be going through everything step by step in some subsequent videos
0:08:48 – 0:08:53

because, again, this is just the way I learn.
0:08:53 – 0:08:56

I don't have to build, integrate, and mess around with things just so I understand things.
0:08:56 – 0:09:01

You know, without understanding those little foundations,
0:09:01 – 0:09:04

MCP might seem like a little magic or a little crazy or you may even not trust it.
0:09:04 – 0:09:09

But the more you get into it, the more you understand it,
0:09:09 – 0:09:12

the more you start peeling back those layers, it's not magic.
0:09:12 – 0:09:16

You'll begin to recognize it's a logical evolution of, you know, proven communication patterns
0:09:16 – 0:09:24

adapted for this AI era that we live in.
0:09:24 – 0:09:27
